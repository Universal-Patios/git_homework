Fist takeaway is that turing is there to support your growth and success. But you need to be organized and motivated to be successful
Second takeaway is that you should try your hardest to figure out problems on your own. But success comes easier when you share problems you cannot solve with your classmates and instructors. Knowing when and how to ask for help is just as important as figuring it out yourself

Strategy one I am committed to trying during the rest of Mod 0 is scheduling times everyday to work on my main project. Breaking each section up into smaller bits. Instead of trying to work on everything all at once

Strategy two is to post more questions and things I am unsure of in the slack channel than I usually would. Usually I just try my best instead of publicly asking for help in that manner
